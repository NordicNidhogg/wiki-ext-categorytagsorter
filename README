CategoryTagSorter - alphabetizes category links at the bottom of an article


== Description ==

MediaWiki typically shows the list of category links in the order in which they appear
in the article. For articles with many categories it can become hard to find the category
you're looking for. This extension simply alphabetizes those links. The sorting is 
ascii-betical, but usually this works out OK as most wikis are configured to have the 
first letter of a title be uppercase (see $wgCapitolLinks.)

This extension adds a user-preference for those users who enjoy searching aimlessly through
lists of categories. 

This extension was written originally for Vistawiki, the internal documentation
site for Vistaprint Inc. 


== Installation ==

Install this extension like any other extension, by adding a line in LocalSettings.php
like this:

 require_once( "$IP/extensions/CategoryTagSorter/CategoryTagSorter.php" );
